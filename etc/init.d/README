/etc/init.d/README for SliTaz init boot scripts.
===============================================================================


SliTaz doesn't use runlevels; inittab starts /etc/init.d/rcS, which uses the
config file /etc/rcS.conf to run all scripts specified with $RUN_SCRIPTS, and
then starts all daemons specified with $RUN_DAEMONS. The idea is to centralize
the main system boot initialization in one configuration file. Init scripts can
use the rc.functions file (part of the base-files) to call for the status
function. Daemons can use /etc/daemons.conf to call for default options; in
this way users/admins don't need to edit the daemon init script located
in the /etc/init.d directory.
